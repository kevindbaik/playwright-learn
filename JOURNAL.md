# My Daily Journal for QA Wolf Take-Home

## Purpose
- The purpose of this file is to journal my daily progress of the take-home challenge.
- Hopefully it gives the reader a little more insight into my thought process and why I decided to do certain things.
- For this project I'm pretending that I represent QA Wolf and Y Combinator is a customer wanting to test their new "Hacker News" feature.

## Day 1: 5/10/2024 (Friday)
### What I Accomplished Today:
  - I practiced using Playwright on small tests and learning more about it's capabilities.
    - There are a bunch of great free resources on YouTube for this including the official Playwright channel!
    - I have experience unit testing w/ JUnit (Java) and unittest (Python), so the transition into understanding e2e testing hasn't been difficult.
  - I familiarized myself with the "customers" website.
    - Before I write any tests, I need a strong understanding of how a user can interact with the website and it's different features.
      - Examples:
        - 1) For users: what does signup/login do? what happens when i click upvote?
        - 2) For posts: what does clicking on "hide", "past", "discuss" do?
        - 3) For navigation: what does clicking on "new", "threads", "past", etc.. do?
    - Understanding these interactions before jumping in is important because it'll help me know what to test.
